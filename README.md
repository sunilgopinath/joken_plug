# JokenPlug

Very basic implementation for demo talk on JWT in elixir. Tests are entirely based off [plug tests](https://github.com/bryanjos/joken/blob/master/test/plug_test.exs)

## Installation

```elixir
git clone git@github.com:sunilgopinath/joken_plug.git
mix deps.get
mix test
mix run --no-halt
```
The application is now running at http://localhost:8080
